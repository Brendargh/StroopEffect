    Abstract 	This paper revisits the conclusion of our previous work
    regarding the dominance of meaning in the competition between
    rhythmic parsing and linguistic parsing. We played five-note rhythm
    patterns in which each sound is a spoken word of a five-word
    sentence. We asked listeners to indicate the starting point of the
    rhythm while disregarding which word would normally be heard as the
    first word of the sentence. In four studies, we varied task demands
    by introducing differences in rhythm complexity, rhythm ambiguity,
    rhythm pairing, and semantic coherence. We found that task
    complexity affects the dominance of meaning. We therefore amend our
    previous conclusion: when processing resources are taxed, listeners
    do not always primarily attend to meaning; instead, they primarily
    attend to the aspect of the pattern (rhythm or meaning) that is more
    salient. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

    Abstract 	Impulse control disorder (ICD) is a class of psychiatric
    disorders characterized by impulsivity – failure to resist a
    temptation, urge or impulse that may harm oneself or others. Many
    psychiatric disorders feature impulsivity, including
    substance-related disorders, behavioral addictions, attention
    deficit hyperactivity disorder, antisocial personality disorder,
    borderline personality disorder, conduct disorder and some mood
    disorders. The fifth edition of the American Psychiatric
    Association's Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders
    (DSM-5) that was published in 2013 includes a new chapter (not in
    DSM-IV-TR) on Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders
    covering disorders "characterized by problems in emotional and
    behavioral self-control". It also includes Impulse-Control Disorders
    Not Elsewhere Classified, which encompasses intermittent explosive
    disorder, pyromania, and kleptomania. Five behavioural stages
    characterize impulsivity: an impulse, growing tension, pleasure on
    acting, relief from the urge and finally guilt (which may or may not
    arise).

    Abstract 	Context-driven control refers to the fast and flexible
    weighting of stimulus dimensions that may be applied at the onset of
    a stimulus. Evidence for context-driven control comes from
    interference tasks in which participants encounter a high proportion
    of incongruent trials at one location and a high proportion of
    congruent trials at another location. Since the size of the
    congruency effect varies as a function of location, this suggests
    that stimulus dimensions are weighted differently based on the
    context in which they appear. However, manipulations of condition
    proportion are often confounded by variations in the frequency with
    which particular stimuli are encountered. To date, there is limited
    evidence for the context-driven control in the absence of stimulus
    frequency confounds. In the current paper, we attempt to replicate
    and extend one such finding [Crump, M. J. C., & Milliken, B. (2009).
    The flexibility of context-specific control: Evidence for
    context-driven generalization of item-specific control settings. The
    Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 62, 1523–1532]. Across
    three experiments we fail to find evidence for context-driven
    control in the absence of stimulus frequency confounds. Based on
    these results, we argue that consistency in the informativeness of
    the irrelevant dimension may be required for context-driven control
    to emerge. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

    Abstract 	Humans typically combine linguistic and nonlinguistic
    information to comprehend emotions. We adopted an emotion
    identification Stroop task to investigate how different channels
    interact in emotion communication. In experiment 1, synonyms of
    “happy” and “sad” were spoken with happy and sad prosody.
    Participants had more difficulty ignoring prosody than ignoring
    verbal content. In experiment 2, synonyms of “happy” and “sad” were
    spoken with happy and sad prosody, while happy or sad faces were
    displayed. Accuracy was lower when two channels expressed an emotion
    that was incongruent with the channel participants had to focus on,
    compared with the cross-channel congruence condition. When
    participants were required to focus on verbal content, accuracy was
    significantly lower also when prosody was incongruent with verbal
    content and face. This suggests that prosody biases emotional verbal
    content processing, even when conflicting with verbal content and
    face simultaneously. Implications for multimodal communication and
    language evolution studies are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

    Abstract 	Stroop effects can be modulated by context-specific cues
    associated with different levels of proportion congruent, even for
    items that appear equally frequently in each context. This result
    has important theoretical implications, because it rules out
    frequency-driven learning explanations of context-specific
    proportion congruent (CSPC) effects and leaves open the possibility
    that a cue-driven retrieval process can reinstate attentional
    control settings in a rapid online fashion. The purpose of the
    present work was to address reproducibility concerns that have been
    raised about this finding. We conducted several reproductions and
    novel extensions using Amazon’s mechanical Turk in both Stroop and
    flanker tasks. We successfully replicated the central finding that
    CSPC effects can be observed for frequency-unbiased items. We also
    provide new Monte Carlo simulation analyses to estimate
    reproducibility of the phenomena that show important limitations on
    these designs for measuring contextual control. [ABSTRACT FROM

    Abstract 	We propose that individuals' valence weighting biases—the
    extent to which they tend to overweight positive or negative valence
    in attitude generalization—play an important role in impulse
    control. Specifically, people who tend to overweight positive
    valence should likewise overweight impulses, which are essentially
    urges to achieve positively-valued outcomes, in their initial
    appraisals of self-control situations, leading to a greater
    likelihood of impulse control failure. Conversely, people who
    underweight positive valence should also underweight impulses in
    these initial evaluative appraisals and should thus be more likely
    to successfully control their impulses. However, we predicted this
    relationship would hold only for individuals low in trait
    self-control, since those high in trait self-control should be both
    motivated and able to override their initial valence weighting-based
    appraisals. We supported these predictions across two studies using
    different impulse control performance measures: a frustrating
    anagram task (Study 1) and a Stroop task (Study 2). [ABSTRACT FROM
